# Project ARIES
General Philosophy and outlining generalized functions behind AI thinking, learning, and analyzing.

Global variables 
	data- input that range of varieties from input from users to sensors
	database- already stored memory

function variables
	learning-
		memorizing
			5questions-
				what- deduction, situtational awareness
				why
				when
				where
				how
				who
		questioning/understanding
		categorizing
	recall-
	analyze-
	apply-


	




main functions {learning, recall, analyze, and apply}

function learning consists of subfunctions
	memorizing, understanding/questioning, and categorizing

		Memorizing: should allow aries to store the data
		5questions: Aries asks 5questions which allows ARIES to anaylze the data.
			What- asking what kind of data is given allows ARIES to deduce what ARIES is being asked of, situtational awareness
			Why- why is am i being asked to do with this data, command, recall, create, answer, 


	memorizing, understanding, and categorizing,
	the function memorizing should allow the Aries to store the input, seek the relevance to the situtation.
